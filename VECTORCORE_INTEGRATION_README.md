   - Error categorization for analytics
   - Error chaining for root cause analysis

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Thread-safe via actors
   - Updateable at runtime
   - Supports global and local configs

4. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Categorical loggers
   - Integration with os.log
   - Performance monitoring support

5. **Async-First Concurrency**
   - Sendable by default
   - Structured concurrency patterns
   - Smart parallelization heuristics

## VectorIndex Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - ~700 lines of new code
- [ ] Implement `IndexError` system (error hierarchy + builder)
- [ ] Add logging infrastructure (5 categorized loggers)
- [ ] Create configuration system (actor-based ThreadSafeConfiguration)
- [ ] Ensure Sendable compliance (audit all public types)

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Week 2) - ~500 line modifications
- [ ] Refactor existing code to use new error system
- [ ] Add logging to hot paths
- [ ] Implement factory pattern for index creation
- [ ] Add protocol extensions to `VectorIndexProtocol`

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish (Week 3) - ~400 lines of tests
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling tests
- [ ] Test logging output and configuration
- [ ] Reorganize test structure (MinimalTests vs ComprehensiveTests)
- [ ] Document patterns and create architecture guide
- [ ] Performance validation

## Key Patterns to Adopt (Priority Order)

1. **Error System** → Best impact on debugging and observability
2. **Logging** → Essential for operations and support
3. **Configuration** → Enables flexible deployment and testing
4. **Factory Pattern** → Improves code organization
5. **Protocol Extensions** → Enhances usability

## Files to Create (Phase 1)

```
Sources/VectorIndex/
├── Errors/
│   ├── IndexError.swift (200 lines)
│   └── ErrorContext.swift (100 lines)
├── Logging/
│   └── IndexLoggers.swift (50 lines)
└── Configuration/
    ├── IndexConfiguration.swift (80 lines)

## Key Consistency Points

### VectorCore → VectorIndex Mapping
| Concept | VectorCore | VectorIndex |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Namespace | `VectorCore` enum | `VectorIndex` enum |
| Error Base | `VectorError` | `IndexError` |
| Config | `Configuration` + `BatchOperations` | `IndexConfiguration` + `IndexConfigurationManager` |
| Logger Categories | Core, Storage, Batch, Metrics, Performance | IndexCore, Search, Persistence, Build, Performance |
| Type Alias | `VectorID` | Reuse VectorCore's `VectorID` |
| Distance Metric | `SupportedDistanceMetric` enum | Reuse VectorCore's `SupportedDistanceMetric` |
| Error Builder | `ErrorBuilder` | `IndexErrorBuilder` |
